Intermediate exam subjects and solution<br>
## Level 0:
**count_of_2:**<br>
Implement a function which counts, for a given integer n, the number of 2s
that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).<br>
<br>
equation: The goal of this exercise is to find all possible answers to the following
**equation:**<br>
<br>
	AB + CA = n
<br>
where A, B, and C are individual digits [0-9] and n is an integer.<br>
<br>
**find_pivot:**<br>
Given an array of integers and its size passed as parameters, create a function able to return the pivot index of this array. <br>
The pivot index is the index where the sum of the numbers on the left
is equal to the sum of the numbers on the right.<br>
<br>
**is_anagram:**<br>
<br>An anagram is a sequence of characters formed by rearranging the letters of

Given two strings as parameters, create a function able to tell whether or
not the first string is an anagram of the second.<br>
<br>
**print_doublon:**<br>
Given two sorted arrays passed as parameters, create a function able to print all the number that are present in one array and in the other, separated by a space. <br>
